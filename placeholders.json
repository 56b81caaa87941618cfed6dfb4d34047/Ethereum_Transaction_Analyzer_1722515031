    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What is Ethereum transaction analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "Ethereum transaction analysis is the process of examining and monitoring new transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to gain insights into on-chain activity, user behavior, and potential security risks or anomalies.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "Why is transaction analysis important?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Transaction analysis helps ensure the integrity and transparency of the Ethereum network by detecting suspicious or illicit activities, identifying potential security vulnerabilities, and providing valuable data for developers, researchers, and regulatory bodies.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What types of data are analyzed?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "Key data points analyzed include transaction details (sender, receiver, value), smart contract interactions, gas usage patterns, and on-chain metadata. This information can reveal insights into network usage, market trends, and potential risks.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "How can I access transaction analysis tools?",
